These images were used for training the teachable machine dataset which made our lives a LOT easier.
We currently only could gather images of Blue eyes, as that is the most common demographic with Wilsons, but later down the line we will look into black eyes to help people in Africa.
All of these images were trained in teachable machine cause it makes our lives like 10x easier and so we don't have to finaggle with linear recursion.
