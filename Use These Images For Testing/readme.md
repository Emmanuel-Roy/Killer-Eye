I would highly reccomend testing the app using these inages.
NONE OF THEM WERE IN THE DATASET OR USED FOR PROCESSING!
These images were chosen as they fit the criteria of what a good image for the classification would look like. 
Most people have darker irises and bad photo skils so it may be less accurate when testing themselves, so please use the images provided for testing purposes.
